            <h2> What this privacy covers </h2>
            <p>The data controller (who determines the purpose and manner in which your personal data is used) is Ennecorta (referred to in this policy as "we" or "us").

                We are committed to doing the right thing when it comes to how we collect, use and protect your personal data. That's why we've developed this privacy and cookies policy ("Policy"), which:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sets out the different ways you interact with us and the types of personal data that we collect</li>
                    <li>explains the reasons why we use the data we collect</li>
                    <li>explains when and why we will share personal data within the Ennecorta Group and with other organisations; and</li>
                    <li>explains the rights and choices you have when it comes to your personal data</li>
                </ul>
                We offer a wide range of products and services, so we want you to be clear about what this Policy covers. This Policy applies to you if you use our services (referred to in this Policy as "our Services").
                
                Using our Services means:
                <ul>
                    <li>Shopping with us over the phone, online (this includes using our kiosks in any of our stores) or otherwise using any of the websites ("our Websites") or mobile applications ("our Mobile Apps")1 where this Policy is posted; or</li>
                    <li>Being a member of the Clubcard loyalty scheme ("Clubcard")</li>
                    <li>This Policy also applies if you contact us or we contact you about our Services</li>
                </ul>
                Parts of this Policy also apply if you use our in-store pharmacy services.
                
                Parts of this Policy also apply to our store CCTV systems where they capture footage of you.
                
                Some other parts of our business (For example, Ennecorta Opticians, Ennecorta Pharmacy and Ennecorta Photo) and other Ennecorta Group companies may need to collect and use personal data to provide you with their products and services and for certain other purposes. They have their own privacy policies that explain how they use your personal data.
                
                Our Websites or Mobile Apps may contain links to other websites operated by other organisations that have their own privacy policies. Please make sure you read the terms and conditions and privacy policy carefully before providing any personal data on a website as we do not accept any responsibility or liability for websites of other organisations.</p>
